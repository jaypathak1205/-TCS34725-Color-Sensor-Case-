# -TCS34725-Color-Sensor-Case-
This repository contains a 3D printable case specifically designed for the **TCS34725 RGB Color Sensor**. The case is used in a **Refined oil quality detection prototype**, where the goal is to shield the sensor from ambient light and ensure accurate color readings from the sample below.

 📐 Dimensions
- Outer Size: 100mm x 100mm
- Height: 50mm
- Wall Thickness: 5mm
- Sensor Slot: Centered square slot for TCS34725

🧪 Application
This case is part of a **Refined oil detection system**. The object/sample (oil in a container) is placed underneath the sensor window inside the box to:
- Prevent external light interference
- Maintain a controlled lighting environment for the TCS34725
- Improve measurement repeatability

- ## 📁 Files
- `RGB Sensor Case v1.stl`: STL file for 3D printing the enclosure
- `images/`: Visual renders of the CAD model

## 🛠️ 3D Printing Guidelines
- Material: PLA or ABS
- Layer height: 0.2 mm
- Infill: 20–30%
- Supports: Not required
- Color: Preferably black (to block light)

## 🔧 Assembly
- Insert the TCS34725 sensor into the square slot on the top surface.
- Secure the sensor using hot glue or 3D-printed brackets if necessary.
- Place the oil sample directly under the box during measurement.
